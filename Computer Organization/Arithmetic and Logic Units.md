Major component of modern computer architectures:
- Von Neumann, Harvard, etc
Fixed point or integer math

**Memory**
- need a cheap way to store millions or billions of bits
- RAM: capacitors: like a bucker that hold a bunch of electrons
- need an addressing method to retrieve memory and bring it to the CPU
- also need a bus system to transport between CPU and memory
- other kinds of memory: EEPROM, Flash, hard drives, floppies, core memory
