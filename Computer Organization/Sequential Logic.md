- Combination Logic Circuits: Have no memory when input is removed, and output is lost.
- Flip-flops: most basic sequel logic
- Store their state memory
#### Flip Flops
- Most basic: 2 crossed AND gates
- 2 outputs opposite of each other
- 2 state or logic circuits, (many flipflops make a multi stable)
