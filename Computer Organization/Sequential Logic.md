- Combination Logic Circuits: Have no memory when input is removed, and output is lost.
- Flip-flops: most basic sequel logic
- Store their state memory
#### Flip Flops
- Most basic: 2 crossed AND gates
- 2 outputs opposite of each other
- 2 state or logic circuits, (many flipflops make a multi stable)
- when changes states, it remains in that state even after momentary input signal changes! <- memory!

- Static RAM: Flip-Flops (4-6) transistors
- Dynamic RAM: Capacitors
- Flip-Flops more 'expensive' (more components, more space on chip) than dynamic RAM
- Registers, cache, etc, use SRAM, more expensive memory for inside CPU
- Dynamic Ram (DRAM) uses cheaper memory, but must be 'refreshed' many times (thousands) per second: slower, but cheaper... (less components, capacitor and a gate)
