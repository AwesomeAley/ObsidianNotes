Types of RAM Memory
- Dynamic Ram (DRAM)
- Static RAM (SRAM)
	- Flip flops
	- registers
	- shift registers
- Phase - Change Memory (PRAM)


### Dynamic RAM
- Can store information for only a few milliseconds 
- must be updated: rewriting data is called 'refreshing' (SRAM doesn't need refreshing)
- RAM memory is lost if electrical power is removed
- data read out is non destructive
- data can be stored, read, changed, and erased (very similar to SRAM functionality)

### ROM Memory
- Read only memory - non-volatile
	-information not lost when electrical power is removed
	some are erasable, but not the same as volatile
