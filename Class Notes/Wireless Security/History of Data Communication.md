Digital computers were invented, and by the late 1950s, there was a demand to network the growing number of business computers being deployed by large companies.

Methods were invented for transmitting digital data between computers over the standard PSTN, using acoustic couplers and telephone sets, creating the first modems. (modulator/demodulator)
	- the noisy nature of the analog-to-digital conversion performed by modems limited the speeds of digital communications.
	- speeds began at 300 bps (baud) and maxed out at ~56kbps in the early 1990s

Before the advent of powerful personal computers, modems also enabled "dumb terminals" to log in remotely to the mainframe. 

#### From Analog to Digital Networks: Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching
Telephone and teletype networks used **circuit switching**, in which a closed-loop electrical circuit is created between the endpoint of each connection. 
- inefficient, because each connection requires an exclusive circuit
- if the circuit is broken at any point, the whole connection fails.
The development of **packet switching** enabled the next leap in long-distance digital communication.
- messages are digitized and chopped up into a series of packets; each packet has a header with information about which connection it is a part of.
