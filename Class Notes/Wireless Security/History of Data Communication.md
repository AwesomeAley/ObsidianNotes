Digital computers were invented, and by the late 1950s, there was a demand to network the growing number of business computers being deployed by large companies.

Methods were invented for transmitting digital data between computers over the standard PSTN, using acoustic couplers and telephone sets, creating the first modems. (modulator/demodulator)
	- the noisy nature of the analog-to-digital conversion performed by modems limited the speeds of digital communications.
	- speeds began at 300 bps (baud) and maxed out at ~56kbps in the early 1990s

Before the advent of powerful personal computers, modems also enabled "dumb terminals" to log in remotely to the mainframe. 

#### From Analog to Digital Networks: Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching
Telephone and teletype networks used **circuit switching**, in which a closed-loop electrical circuit is created between the endpoint of each connection. 
- inefficient, because each connection requires an exclusive circuit
- if the circuit is broken at any point, the whole connection fails.
The development of **packet switching** enabled the next leap in long-distance digital communication.
- messages are digitized and chopped up into a series of packets; each packet has a header with information about which connection it is a part of.
- The same physical wires can be used for many logical connections; routers and switches examine packets to route them to their destination
Much more robust, because losing individual packets doesn't terminate the connection and packets can use multiple routes to get to their destination routing around congestion and failures. This method was also implemented for telephone communication.

#### The Internet
The U.S. government's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) became involved in research and development of computer networks.

The ARPANET (est. 1969) was the precursor to the internet, the first public packet-switched data network; further packet switching research led to the development of the TCP/IP protocols
