All wireless communications are by means of electromagnetic (EM) waves. All radiation on the spectrum are the same type of EM waves, just at different frequencies. They propagate at the speed of light: c~ 300,000,000 m/s (5.879 trillion miles)

A fundamental property of an EM wave is its **frequency**, measured in Hertz, which is cycles per second.
- 1 hz = 1 cycle/second
**Wavelength** is the distance between successive peaks of a wave. Because it is distance, it is measured in the SI unit of meters. It is inversely proportional to frequency (higher frequency means shorter wavelength) We can easily find the wavelength of any frequency wave with the following formula:

wavelength  = propagation speed / frequency

**Amplitude** is the maximum displacement of a wave. We think of it as simply the signal's strength or power. Measured in watts
For 2.4GHz, WI-FI "full power" of a transmitting AP is 100mW. For 5GHz, its 200mW.
Typically client devices will use lower power to save battery life. A smartphone will typically transmit with 15mw.
Consumer microwave ovens use RF emissions at a frequency of 2.45 Ghz but a typical power of 1000 watts
AM radio towers may transmit with power of up to 50,000 watts

**Phase** is a measure of how much the peaks of two waves at the same frequency are in or out of alignment. Measured in degrees between 0 (fully in phase) and 180 (fully out of phase).
