- Strong knowledge of computer network technologies, protocols/topologies, digital forensics and endpoint protection, or threat intelligence
- Software development, programming and/or scripting experience (Perl, Python, C, Java, PHP, ASP, etc.)
- **Ability to track threat actors across Dark Web criminal forums and marketplaces and ability to communicate findings. Identify leaked client data on open and closed (Deep and Dark Web) sources**
	- DarkWeb marketplace: genesis market, breachforums, white house market
	- Monitor for crednetial leaks: Have I been pwned (check if credentials have been compromised), darkTracer, darkOwl, OSINT open-source techniques, 
- Ability to track malware campaigns and understand adversarial activity from an intelligence perspective
- **Basic understanding of intelligence, including intelligence lifecycle, Kill Chain, Diamond model, and Priority Intelligence Requirements
	- intelligence life cycle: planning/direction, collection, processing, analysis, sharing, feedback
	- Priority intelligence requirements are areas that an organization has identified that require the most attention. (Threat actors/APTs that might target and their TTPs, what vulns may be exploited, what CVEs/methods are exploited/used in our industry and against our assets

- Assess security of client networks, hosts, and applications
- Determine technical, business impact and likelihood of identified security issues and provide remediation guidance to clients
	 discuss GRC documents and work Christian Brothers Services
- **Perform analysis and testing to verify the strengths and weaknesses of mobile and web applications and web services (SOAP, WSDL, UDDI)
	- SOAP (simple object access protocol): a protocol used for exchanging information in web services. Formatted in XML, platform-independent allowing different applications to communicate
	- WSDL (web services description language): XML language for describing services provided by SOAP
	- UDDI (universal description, discovery, and integration): directory service allowing businesses to register and discover web services
	- *"When analyzing and testing the security of mobile and web applications, as well as SOAP-based web services, I start by performing dynamic application security testing (DAST) with tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to identify common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF. For mobile apps, I use static application security testing (SAST) with tools like MobSF to look for weaknesses like insecure data storage or API security flaws. When assessing SOAP-based web services, I review WSDL files to ensure they don’t expose sensitive internal details and check for vulnerabilities like XML External Entity (XXE) injection or weak authentication methods, using tools like SoapUI to craft and analyze SOAP requests. I also ensure UDDI registries are properly secured with access controls to prevent unauthorized discovery of services. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities across both web and mobile apps, as well as web services, and recommend mitigations like strong encryption, input validation, and secure authentication to protect the organization’s assets."*
- **Perform Internet penetration testing using blackbox and whitebox methodologies
		blackbox: you dont have information (simulates a real attacker)
		whitebox: you have information so you can conduct a more detailed analysis
- Review application code, system configurations and device configurations using manual and automated techniques
- **Measure and report clients’ compliance with established industry or government requirements
	- GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, FISMA, SOX, NIST cybersecurity framework, ISOC,IEC 27001, NIST sp 800-53, 
- Perform analytical investigations into specific threat actors, ransomware, and campaigns- 
- Create and review threat intelligence programs for clients using established intelligence models
