## ChatGPT initial advice

1. **Set a Moderate Deficit**
    
    - Your current intake (~3355 kcal) has you gaining weight.
        
    - Start by reducing **300-500 kcal/day** (~2850-3050 kcal) and adjust based on progress.
        
    - Aim for **1-1.5 lbs of fat loss per week** to avoid muscle loss.
        
2. **Macronutrient Adjustments**
    
    - **Protein**: Keep it at **1g-1.2g per pound of lean body mass** (around **175-200g protein/day**).
        
    - **Fats**: Don’t drop too low—**~0.3-0.4g per pound** (~55-75g).
        
    - **Carbs**: Adjust as needed based on energy levels, filling the rest of your calories.
        
3. **Resistance Training Priority**
    
    - Keep lifting heavy to signal your body to maintain muscle.
        
    - Maintain intensity and volume but consider **reducing excessive failure sets** to avoid burnout in a deficit.
        
    - If you’re not already, add some **progressive overload tracking** to maintain muscle.
        
4. **Increase Daily Activity (NEAT & Cardio)**
    
    - **10k+ steps per day**
        
    - **Add 2-4 cardio sessions/week** (start with 20-30 min of LISS or 1-2 HIIT sessions).
        
    - If fat loss stalls, increase activity **before slashing more calories**.
        
5. **Track Progress & Adjust Weekly**
    
    - Weigh yourself daily (same time) and track the weekly average.
        
    - Aim for **~0.5-1% body weight loss per week** (1-1.5 lbs/week).
        
    - If no loss after 10-14 days, reduce **calories by ~150-200/day** or increase activity.
