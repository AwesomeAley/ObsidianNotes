##### SOX
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The main purpose of SOX is to enhance transparency, accountability, and financial reporting within publicly traded companies. It imposes a range of requirements on these companies and their auditors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial statements. Some key provisions of SOX include:

1. **Corporate Governance**: SOX established new standards for corporate governance and requires companies to have independent audit committees made up of non-executive directors.
    
2. **CEO and CFO Certification**: The CEO and CFO of a publicly traded company are required to personally certify the accuracy of their company's financial statements and disclosures.
    
3. **Internal Controls**: Companies are required to establish and maintain internal controls over financial reporting to ensure the reliability and accuracy of financial statements.
    
4. **Whistleblower Protection**: SOX provides protection for employees who report accounting irregularities or other forms of corporate fraud, shielding them from retaliation.
    
5. **Auditor Independence**: It restricts the types of non-audit services that auditing firms can provide to their clients, to reduce potential conflicts of interest.
    
6. **Enhanced Financial Disclosures**: SOX requires companies to provide more detailed and timely financial disclosures to the public.
    
7. **Penalties for Non-Compliance**: The law imposes significant penalties, including fines and imprisonment, for non-compliance with its provisions.
