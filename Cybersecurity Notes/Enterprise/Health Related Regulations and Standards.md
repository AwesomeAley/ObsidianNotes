##### HIPAA  
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

1. **Portability**: It aims to ensure that individuals can maintain their health insurance coverage when they change jobs or if they have pre-existing medical conditions. This aspect of HIPAA allows for the continuity of health insurance coverage.
    
2. **Accountability**: HIPAA also includes provisions that establish standards for the protection of sensitive patient health information, known as Protected Health Information (PHI). This includes electronic, written, and oral forms of PHI. The law mandates safeguards to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this information.
    

Additionally, HIPAA grants certain rights to individuals regarding their health information. These include the right to access their own health records, request corrections, and obtain an accounting of disclosures.

Healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, are required to comply with HIPAA regulations. Failure to do so can result in significant fines and penalties.
