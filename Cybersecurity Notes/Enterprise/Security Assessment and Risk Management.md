  
Security assessment and risk management are core practices in cybersecurity. Security assessment involves evaluating an organization's digital infrastructure to uncover vulnerabilities and threats with an [[Infrastructure Evaluation]]. Risk Management focuses on identifying and mitigating potential security risks. Together, they form a proactive strategy to protect against cyber threats and safeguard sensitive information. In a constantly evolving digital landscape, these practices are crucial for maintaining a robust security posture.

Security assessment involves a systematic evaluation of an organization's information systems, networks, and infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities and potential threats. Here are the key steps typically involved in a security assessment:

1. [[Defining Scope and Objectives]]: Clearly define the scope of the assessment, specifying the systems, networks, and assets to be evaluated. Set specific objectives and goals for the assessment, such as identifying vulnerabilities, testing compliance with security policies, or evaluating incident response procedures.
    
2. **Asset Identification**/[[Infrastructure Evaluation]]: Catalog all assets, including hardware, software, applications, data repositories, and network components. This step ensures that no critical elements are overlooked during the assessment.
    
3. **Vulnerability Identification**: Utilize scanning tools and techniques to identify known vulnerabilities in the systems and applications. This includes software patches, misconfigurations, and other weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.
    
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified vulnerabilities. This step helps prioritize which vulnerabilities need immediate attention based on their potential to cause harm or disruption.
    
5. **Penetration Testing (Optional)**: Conduct controlled simulated attacks to test the security defenses of systems and networks. This step goes beyond vulnerability scanning by actively attempting to exploit weaknesses.
    
6. **Compliance and Policy Review**: Ensure that the organization's security policies and procedures are in line with industry standards and regulatory requirements. Identify any gaps or areas of non-compliance that need to be addressed.
    
7. **Social Engineering (Optional)**: Test the human element of security by simulating phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques to assess the organization's susceptibility to manipulation.
    
8. **Incident Response Assessment**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the organization's incident response plan and procedures. This involves simulating various security incidents to ensure that the response is timely and appropriate.
    
9. **Documentation and Reporting**: Document all findings, including vulnerabilities, risks, and areas of non-compliance. Provide detailed reports with recommendations for remediation and improvement.
    
10. **Remediation and Mitigation**: Develop and implement a plan to address identified vulnerabilities and risks. This may involve applying patches, reconfiguring systems, or implementing additional security controls.
    
11. **Continuous Monitoring and Review**: Establish ongoing monitoring processes to stay vigilant against new threats and vulnerabilities. Regularly review and update security measures to adapt to evolving risks.
    
12. **Post-Assessment Review**: After remediation efforts, conduct a follow-up assessment to verify that vulnerabilities have been addressed and that security measures have been effectively implemented.
