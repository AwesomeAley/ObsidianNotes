##### FERPA
FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, is a federal law in the United States enacted in 1974. Its main purpose is to protect the privacy of student education records. FERPA applies to all educational institutions that receive federal funding, including public schools and most private schools.

Key aspects of FERPA include:

1. **Access to Records**: FERPA grants parents and eligible students (those who are 18 years or older or attending a post-secondary institution) the right to access and review their educational records. These records include transcripts, report cards, and other documents maintained by the educational institution.
    
2. **Privacy Rights**: FERPA prohibits the release of personally identifiable information from student records without consent, except in certain specified circumstances. This means that schools cannot disclose a student's information to third parties without the consent of the student or their parent/guardian.
    
3. **Right to Amend Records**: FERPA allows parents and eligible students to request corrections or amendments to their education records if they believe the information is inaccurate or misleading.
    
4. **Exceptions**: There are exceptions to FERPA's consent requirements, such as in cases of health and safety emergencies, compliance with a court order, or disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests.
