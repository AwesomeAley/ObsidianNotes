### The OSI 7-Layer Model
Meaningful end-to-end communication between applications is made possible not by a single protocol but by a stacks of interoperating protocols, each of which handles different aspects of communication.
The 7-layer model was standardized to have a consistent way to talk about those layers and what they do.
Code that implements protocols for each layer typically only communicates with the layers directly above and below.
