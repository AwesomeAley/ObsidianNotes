## IPv4 Addressing
Fundamental to moving data to its destination on a network is a system for identifying those destinations-*addressing*.
AN IPv4 address is 32 bits, written as four 8 bit number, or octets (between 0 and 255)

### Subnet Masks
The left bits of an IP address are the same for all addresses on a given network; the right bits identify an individual host.
Where the split is between the network and the host part can  vary
A subnet mask is a 32-bit string where the bits corresponding to the network are all 1's and the bits corresponding to the host are all zeroes.
