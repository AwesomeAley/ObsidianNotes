Establish device certificates
If your network has a certificate authority, use this external CA, otherwise (as in CCDC) you may generate these locally.

Navigate to **Device > Certificates** and click **Generate**. First create your Forward Trust certificate
with an appropriate name, a unique common name, checkmark *Certificate Authority* and apply certificate attributes to prevent device confusion.

Do the same for your Forward Untrust certificate authority.

Click on each CA once generated and checkmark the appropriate characteristic
