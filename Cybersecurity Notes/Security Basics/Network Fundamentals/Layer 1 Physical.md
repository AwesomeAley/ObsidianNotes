The physical layer defines how actual bits are transmitted between devices, and thus cannot be defined in a purely logical manner.

Involves specifications related to:
- Transmission - Bit-by-bit procedures
- Electrical - Signal levels, amplification, and attenuation
- Mechanical - Specifications for cables (type, length) and connectors
- Procedural - Modulation schemes, synchronization, signaling, and multiplexing
- Wireless Transmissions - Frequencies, signal strength, and bandwith
- Throughput - Bit rates
- Topologies - bus, ring, mesh, point-to-point, and point-to-multipoint

### Protocols Defined at Layer 1
• Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET)/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)
• Digital subscriber line (DSL)
• TI/EI
• Integrated Services for Digital Networks (ISDN)
• Ethernet Physical Layer
• Bluetooth
• 802.11 (Wi-Fi)
The complexity of layer 1 has mushroomed with the growth of wireless technologies. Maybe it should be considered as multiple layers now?
