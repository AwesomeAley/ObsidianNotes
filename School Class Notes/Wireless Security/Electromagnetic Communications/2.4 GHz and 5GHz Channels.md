The WI-FI standards define multiple channels within the bandwidth defined for the standard. Having multiple networks in the same area operating on different channels helps minimize interference.

The 2.4 GHz range has 11 allowed channels in the US and 13 in most other countries. 802.11n and -ac support bonded 40 Mhz channels for higher throughput.

### 5GHz Channels

5 GHz WI-FI uses a selection of frequency ranges from the U-NII (Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure) bands defined by the FCC.
Base channels width of 20MHz, but channel bonding can be used to create wider channels up to 160 MHz. WI-FI 6 has expanded into the U-NII-4 channels at 5.9 GHz. Notice the channel number ranging from 36 to 177.
