The WI-FI standards define multiple channels within the bandwidth defined for the standard. Having multiple networks in the same area operating on different channels helps minimize interference.

The 2.4 GHz range has 11 allowed channels in the US and 13 in most other countries. 802.11n and -ac support bonded 40 Mhz channels for higher throughput.
