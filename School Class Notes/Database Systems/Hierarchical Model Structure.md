Usually searched using a standard tree traversal algorithm
- The most frequently accessed nodes are placed at the most quickly accessed spots
- Dependent on the algorithm used


## Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages
- Conceptually simple
- can be very efficient
- ensure data integrity

**Disadvantages**
- Need physical knowledge of how data are stored in order to access it
- Rigid design so adding new fields requires that the entire database be redesigned
- only one parent and no linkages between children
- no standardized data access language


## Traversal Algorithms

### **Preorder Traversal**

The root is processed first, before the left and right nodes

### **Inorder Traversal**

The left node is processed first, then the root, and finally the right node

### **Inorder Traversal

The left node is processed first, then the root, and finally the right node
