##### There are **six** phases to a penetration test
- **Reconnaissance**: Learning as much as you can about the company and its setup before you try to do anything
- **Scanning**: Actively probe the networks and computers to find your best point of attack
- **Gaining Access**: Break in by running exploit code that will give you initial access
- **Escalating Privileges**: Using the existing access as leverage, execute further exploits to raise your privilege level, so you can accomplish the desired damage/actions
- **Maintaining Access**: Install a *backdoor* so that you can continue to have access to the system
- **Covering your tracks**: Alter system configuration to prevent detection of your actions

All steps, phases, and attempts must be documented. Pent testers are hired to clearly show where vulnerabilities lie in an effort to fix them
