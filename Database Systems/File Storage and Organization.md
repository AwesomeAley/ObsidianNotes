• A track is divided into sectors.
• A sector typically holds 512bytes.
• A block is a collection of one of more sectors.
• A cylinder is a set of concentric tracks

#### [[Calculating Hard Drive Performance]]

**Categorizations of Hard Drives**
- Rotation speed: usually 5400,7200, or 10000 rpm
- Number of sectors per track
- Data access time• Cache
- Interface
- [[RAID Storage]]
