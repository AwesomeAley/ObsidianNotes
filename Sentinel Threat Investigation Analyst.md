Understand IR lifecycle
steps of IR
walk me through a specific security incident and how you handled it
what technologies are you familiar with
what tools do you use to stay up to date on security trends

I had a jr interview a few weeks back. I drilled all the SOC interview questions I found on Google and found it helped ease my mind, even though they only asked two questions out of all of the ones I drilled. They mainly asked how I keep up to date, what do I do if I can’t find an answer, port#s(make sure you know the secure port too) what is and how to mitigate XSS, what are the privileged AD account types, and some others I don’t remember on top of scenario questions. One was what do if someone logs into their account with an IP out of Russia.

It’s a JR position, they won’t expect you to know everything. They just want someone with passion who is hungry for more. Keep doing the tryhackme courses soc level 1 is going to be fantastic to finish. Speak of what you do in your free time to learn more, that’s the most important since this field is constantly changing.
