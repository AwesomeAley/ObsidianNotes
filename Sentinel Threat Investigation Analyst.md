Understand IR lifecycle
steps of IR
walk me through a specific security incident and how you handled it
what technologies are you familiar with
what tools do you use to stay up to date on security trends
how would you go about investigating an alert

I had a jr interview a few weeks back. I drilled all the SOC interview questions I found on Google and found it helped ease my mind, even though they only asked two questions out of all of the ones I drilled. They mainly asked how I keep up to date, what do I do if I can’t find an answer, port#s(make sure you know the secure port too) what is and how to mitigate XSS, what are the privileged AD account types, and some others I don’t remember on top of scenario questions. One was what do if someone logs into their account with an IP out of Russia.



  
While it's important to be able to answer the questions they ask, it's also important to have a few of your own.

You're going to be analyzing SOMETHING, so a question on the types of analysis might be useful (e.g. if you're analyzing cyber security risks, ask if they use quantitative or qualitative methodologies).

Ask about some frameworks - find the industry the company is in and find a few frameworks that apply (start with NIST and MITRE and find the specific frameworks that apply). Read a little into them and then ask a question about what frameworks they align to.

Look into the CISSP certification. You're not qualified for it (you need 5+ years of experience in at least 3(?) of the 8 domains) but look at the key domains, identify the domain you're going to be working in, and ask questions specific to it. If the listing is vague (i.e. possibly small company where you'll have a lot of hats), ask broader questions to identify what you'll be working on.

Don't be afraid to turn the interview into a conversation- it doesn't have to be one person (or a panel) drilling you with questions. You have to remember you're also interviewing them to determine whether or not you want to work with them.
